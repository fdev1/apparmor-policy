	# This is a small suid program that:
	#
	# 1. Removes the client IP from the iptables
	#    recent module "ssh_bad" list (actually need to
	#    provide the list name at compile time)
	#
	# 2. Drops to use privilege and executes the user
	#    shell or the command specified by the ssh client.
	#
	# It is necessary to ensure that any commands executed
	# via ssh are executed on their own profile but sshd can
	# still execute programs that inherit it's profile (to read
	# ssh keys for example).
	#
	# In order for this to work the following needs to
	# be added to sshd_config:
	#
	# ForceCommand /usr/bin/ssh-cmdexec
	#
	# See: https://github.com/fernando-rodriguez/misc/blob/master/ssh-cmdexec.c
	#
	/usr/bin/ssh-cmdexec rpx,
